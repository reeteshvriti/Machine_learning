# BoomBikes Sharing predection
> Outline a brief description of your project.
You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions
The Demand of the bike depends on the Year, either its weekday or weekends, also the climate condition like summer, rainfall, winter and also depends on the if there is snow fall or not.
